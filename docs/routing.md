# Routing

React Webpack Boilerplate by Adrian uses [React Router v4]() for easy-to-use routing between modules. To access route information and functions from a component, mobx-react-router provides a `routing` store ready to be injected.

The example has three basic routes, and they are descibed in

```
📁 app
    📁 components
        📁 App
            📄 index.js
```

Please see the [React Router]() documentation for advanced usage.

## JWT Authentication

[gothinkster/react-mobx-realworld-example-app](https://github.com/gothinkster/react-mobx-realworld-example-app/tree/master/src) has a very good example how to enable authentication.
