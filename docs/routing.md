> **components:** encapsulated React components that are driven solely by props and don't talk to Redux. Same as “dumb components”. They should stay the same regardless of your router, data fetching library, etc.

> **containers** React components that are aware of Redux, Router, etc. They are more coupled to the app. Same as “smart components”.
